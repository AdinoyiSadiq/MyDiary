					On the 1st of November 2017, I set out to do something that I’ve always dreamed of doing; become a data scientist.

					Data science is something that I wanted to do even before I knew the term.

					I grew up on Asimov’s stories of mechanical men and was intrigued by the idea of making intelligent things. As I got older, I taught myself the Python programming language, studied engineering and built intelligent physical systems.

					It turns out that the thing that I was truly interested in was the software that ran the systems, the ghost in the machine.

					I have since spent many months learning as much as I could about modern software engineering and now I want to embark on a new and exciting journey.
